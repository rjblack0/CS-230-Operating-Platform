Who was the client and what type of software did they want?

The client was The Gaming Room, who was seeking to adapt their Android game 'Draw It or Lose It' into a web-based application. They wanted the new version to run reliably across multiple platforms, be scalable, secure, and optimized for web delivery.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel I did particularly well in defining and building the architecture and constraints. In the end I recommended using a Linux-based, cloud-hosted deployment, along with the client-server model and modular design, in order to provide a strong balance between cost-effectiveness, scalability, and security.

What part of the design document process was most helpful?

I feel that I got the most benefit from working through the domain model and evaluation sections. The domain model helped me to understand the relationships between classes and gave me context to object-oriented principles like inheritance and encapsulation. The platform evaluation made forced me to think critically about development environments and deployment strategies.

What would you revise if given the chance?

I would refine the requirements section. While I did succeed in outlining constraints, I could have expanded it to map each business requirement and match them to the technical solutions. This would have made the document even clearer for developers and non-technical stakeholders.

How did you interpret and implement the userâ€™s needs?

I focused on platform independence, security, and performance. The Singleton pattern addressed the requirement for only one game instance; inheritance and composition improved reusability; and cloud hosting ensured scalability and reliability. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the final product is not just technically sound, but actually usable, stable, and enjoyable for its intended audience.

How did you approach designing software, and what will you use in the future?

I approached this design using object-oriented design principles, architectural analysis, and evaluation of system trade-offs. In the future, I would continue using strategies like domain modeling, requirement-to-solution mapping, and cloud-based architecture planning. I would also incorporate iterative feedback cycles with stakeholders earlier in the process to strengthen alignment between design and user needs.
